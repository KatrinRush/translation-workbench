# translation-workbench
Private translation workflow tool with AI-assisted analysis, translation, terminology, rules and project management.

## Connections

Connections stores provider credentials with authenticated encryption. Generate a Fernet key once:

```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

Set the generated value before starting Workbench:

```bash
export WORKBENCH_CREDENTIALS_KEY='generated-key'
python -m backend.server
```

The key is not stored in SQLite or the repository. Keep it in the environment or a secret manager. Workbench starts normally without it, but creating, editing, and testing Connections is disabled. Existing encrypted Connections appear locked. Losing or replacing the key makes existing credentials unreadable; credential rotation is not implemented yet.

To add DeepL, open **Налаштування**, find **Connections**, select **Налаштувати** for DeepL, enter the API key, and save. **Перевірити** calls only the DeepL usage endpoint to validate access; translation is not implemented.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Backend provider tests use an injected fake HTTP transport and never call the real DeepL API. E2E tests require `WORKBENCH_CREDENTIALS_KEY` to be set before Playwright starts the server.
